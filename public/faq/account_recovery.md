## Account Recovery

If you've forgotten your username or password, click on the "Forgot Password?" link on the login page. Enter your registered email, and you'll receive an email containing a secure link to reset your password. Please ensure to check your spam or junk folders if you do not see the email within a few minutes. If you no longer have access to your registered email, contact our customer support team directly through our help center. You may be asked to verify your identity through additional security questions to ensure the safety and privacy of your account.
