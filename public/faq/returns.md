## Returns Policy

If a component or appliance does not meet your specifications, you may request a return within 30 days of delivery. Items must be unused, unmodified, and in their original packaging. Log in to your account, open your order history, and select "Return Item" to generate a return label. Securely pack the items and drop them at your nearest shipping center. Once our technicians confirm the products are in new condition—typically within 3 business days—we will process your return. For assistance, email support@automation.example.com or call +1-800-555-0199.
