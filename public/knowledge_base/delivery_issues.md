## Delivery Issues

When asked about delivery timeline, use the get_order tool to check the delivery status.

If delays exceed acceptable thresholds (10 business days), create a complaint on behalf of the customer using the create_complaint tool.

If appropriate, offer free shipment or store credit using the issue_voucher tool.
