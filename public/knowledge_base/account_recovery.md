## Account Recovery

If a technician cannot access the automation service portal using the standard email reset process, first verify their facility ID and a recent service order number. Once verified:

Use the reset_password tool to send a recovery link to the registered email.

If the user no longer has access to that email, update their contact information with the update_info tool before resending the link.

Remind them to change the password immediately after regaining access to keep control systems secure.
