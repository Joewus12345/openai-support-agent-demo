# Corporate Social Responsibility
TAGG aims to impact our community and society at large. Even as we work responsibly and hold ourselves accountable for a sustainable environment, we also seek to accomplish direct social impact through initiatives that support Education and Healthcare.
Our CSR interventions aim to accomplish the following:
  1. To support brilliant, needy pupils through the Future Leaders Educational Fund with the provision of books, stationary, shoes, school uniforms, school bags and payment of levies annually in order to reduce the incidence of pupils dropping out of school due to the inability of parents and families to provide.
  2. To support the Baatsona TMA Primary and Junior High School with teaching and learning aids so as to improve the quality of teaching and learning in the school.
  3. To promote the interest of pupils of the Baatsona TMA Primary and Junior High School in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics through the activities of the STEM Club (Infinity Club)
  4. To support the fight against breast cancer through partnerships with recognized health care organisations engaged in sensitisation and in provision of access to diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer for the less privileged.


## Future Leaders’ Educational Fund
The Future Leaders’ Educational Fund was established in September 2015. Over the years, the company has enrolled over 70 pupils since 2015 providing basic necessities such as school uniforms, stationery, shoes, bags, textbooks and other required learning materials. Every academic year, more pupils are enrolled as students graduate from the Junior High school with several past students supported in diverse ways to enrol in Senior High School.
The Baatsonaa TWMA Primary and JHS, has also been supported in diverse ways, with the aim of improving teaching and learning. Teacher’s tables and chairs, pupil desks, ICT equipment, science kits, stationary and other learning aids have been donated.
A STEM club, also known as the Infinity Club has been set up targeting pupils from Primary 4 to JHS 2. The aim of the club is to ignite the interest of students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. During these sessions, concepts are broken down to enhance understanding and pupils get hands on experience using kits and other science experiments.
