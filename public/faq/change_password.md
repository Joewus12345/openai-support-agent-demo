## Change Password

For your account security, we recommend regularly updating your password. To change your password, simply log in to your account, navigate to "Account Settings," and select the "Change Password" option. You will be prompted to enter your current password, followed by your new password twice for confirmation. We advise choosing a strong and unique password, ideally combining letters, numbers, and special characters to ensure maximum account protection.
