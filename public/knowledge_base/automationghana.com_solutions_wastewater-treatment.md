![Wastewater Treatment](https://automationghana.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Picture12.png)
## Optimizing Aeration in Wastewater Treatment
In the food and beverage industry, wastewater treatment is a critical component. Our advanced aeration monitoring and control system is designed to significantly reduce energy consumption while maintaining optimal water quality. Given that aeration accounts for 45-75% of total energy use in wastewater treatment, optimizing this process is crucial for both operational efficiency and environmental compliance.
## Hardware/Software
  * Dissolved Oxygen Sensor (Oxymax COS61D)
  * Pressure Transmitter (Deltabar PMP51B)
  * Liquiline transmitter for data recording and pump control ( CM44x)
  * Active Power measurement with an Energy Meter
