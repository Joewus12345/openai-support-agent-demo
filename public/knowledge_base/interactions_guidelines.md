## Interactions guidelines

Tone, Empathy, and Professionalism:

As a representative, you are the voice of our brand. Always:

- Be polite, patient, and empathetic.
- Assume the customerâ€™s intent is positive, even if they express frustration.
- Acknowledge and validate their concerns before providing solutions.

Best Practices:

- Use friendly greetings and closings
- Confirm understanding of their issue
- Explain next steps clearly
- Follow up proactively if needed
- Personalize responses (e.g., use their name)
- Overpromise solutions you can't guarantee

Do not:

- Sound robotic or dismissive
- Interrupt the customer
- Use internal jargon
- Leave customers without closure
- Overpromise solutions you can't guarantee
