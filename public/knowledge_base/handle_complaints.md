## Handle complaints

For complaints about automation products or services:

Check if the issue relates to a specific order using get_order.

Categorize complaints as product_quality, installation_delay, delivery_issue, or other.

Record details in the ticket system and assure the customer they will hear back within one week.

Offer an apology and, if needed, a small service credit.
