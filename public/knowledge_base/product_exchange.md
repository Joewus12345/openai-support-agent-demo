## Product Exchange

If the customer struggles with initiating an exchange:

Manually process the exchange.

Use the create_return tool to generate a return.

Inform the customer that they will receive a return label via email and communicate expected timelines (usually, returns are processed within 3 business days).

Explain that once the return is processed, they can ask for a replacement here or via their orders page.
