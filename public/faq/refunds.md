## Refunds Policy

Refunds are issued to your original payment method after returned components or appliances pass inspection. We typically process refunds within 3 business days of receiving your items. You'll receive an email confirmation once the transaction is complete. Depending on your payment provider, funds may take additional time to appear in your account. For any refund questions, contact our accounting team at support@automation.example.com or call +1-800-555-0199.
