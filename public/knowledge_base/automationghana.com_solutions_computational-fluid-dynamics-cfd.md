  3. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)


## Optimize Cooling Efficiency with Advanced Fluid Flow Simulations 
Maintaining optimal cooling in data centers is critical to ensuring the smooth operation of servers and other equipment. Our Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions enable HVAC design engineers to visualize airflow patterns, predict flow distribution, and optimize cooling strategies—ultimately reducing cooling costs and enhancing system performance.
## Our CFD services provide real-time monitoring and recording of critical cooling parameters
**Supply Temperature:** Real-time visualization and management of supply air temperatures to maintain optimal conditions.
**Supply Airflow Rate:** Predict and regulate airflow rates to prevent overheating and ensure even cooling across all racks.
**Rack Cooling Effectiveness (RCI):** Evaluate and enhance rack cooling performance, ensuring all equipment operates within safe temperature limits.
**Cooling Cost Function:** Optimize cooling strategies to reduce energy consumption and minimize operational costs.
