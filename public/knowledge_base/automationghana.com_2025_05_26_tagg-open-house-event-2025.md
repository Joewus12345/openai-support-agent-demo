# TAGG Open House Event: Celebrating 20+ Years of Excellence in Engineering
  * [ May 26, 2025 ](https://automationghana.com/2025/05/26/)


For **over twenty years** , The Automation Ghana Group (TAGG) has been a **beacon in the Ghanaian industrial and building automation landscape** , serving stakeholders with top-notch solutions through an unwavering commitment to excellence and an unrelenting desire to meet and exceed clients’ expectations.
In celebration of this 20+ year odyssey, a three-day event, “ _Open House,_ ” was organized at TAGG headquarters from April 23rd to April 25th, 2025, to reflect on our journey and immerse stakeholders in our storied history. This unforgettable celebration brought together our esteemed clients, potential partners, and team members, creating an avenue for meaningful discussions as we look towards the future.
![TAGG Directors and other dignitaries at Open House Launch](http://automationghana.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Open-House-Picturess_Website-02-1.jpg)
**Dignitaries from** leading companies in the **food** and**beverage, oil** and**gas, power** and**energy, telecommunication, and mining industries were present at the event**. Following the welcome of our distinguished guests, our company leaders took to the stage to reflect on our journey, highlighting key milestones, successes, and failures, along with valuable lessons that ultimately shaped TAGG into the company it is today.

**Ing. Kweku Asmah** , the **founder and CEO of The Automation Ghana Group** , recounted TAGG’s journey from humble beginnings to becoming a trusted name in industrial and building automation solutions across Ghana and West Africa. He, along with his friend and business partner, **Rudolph Matey** , discovered a gap in engineering and automation services in Ghana, and two years after graduating from engineering school, the pair set out to bridge that gap. “ _Our mission was to deliver reliable repair and maintenance solutions complemented by exceptional after-sales support to the country’s manufacturing sector_ ,” Ing. Asmah recalled. “ _There was a pressing need for this service because Rudolph’s company frequently had to invite engineers from abroad to travel to Ghana and fix basic faults. This was both time-consuming and costly, causing delays and increasing expenses for his customers. For about a year, Rudolph and I discussed our vision. During this time, I shared my intentions with my brother, who provided guidance and coaching to help refine our path forward. Finally, the time came, and we each contributed 350 million old Ghana cedis_ _to_ _**launch the company in September 2003 officially**_.”

He also reflected on the company’s remarkable growth and the factors that fuelled it. “ _For ten years, we grew slowly but steadily.__Then in 2013, we embarked on a bold new project. Together with my management team, we launched a 5-year growth plan, which has led to the tremendous achievements that you see today. During these times, my wife Anita was my greatest source of strength and encouragement. Today, our presence is felt across multiple industries, including education, real estate, telecom, mining, food & beverage, and oil & gas. In Ghana, the majority of automation engineers have interacted with us, whether as former employees, project collaborators, or trainees who have attended our graduate trainee programmes. **Between 2014 and 2018,** we established two additional companies, **ASL** and **ESL**.”_
In his closing remarks _,_ Ing. Asmah expressed his pride in TAGG’s status as a pacesetter in the industry, and emphasised the company’s commitment to the pursuit of excellence and national development moving forward._“Today, we see numerous companies following our footsteps, aspiring to replicate our success. We take great pride in being the pacesetters, leading the way for others to build upon what we started. Moving forward, we will continue to be the pacesetters. I encourage all of you to watch out for us, as we deploy the latest technologies in our field, contributing to the development of Ghana, our motherland._ ”
