## Refunds Policy

Refunds are typically processed within 7 business days after your returned item reaches our facility and passes inspection. Refunds are automatically issued to your original payment method. You will receive an email notification confirming the refund details once the transaction is complete. Depending on your payment provider, it might take additional time for the refund to appear on your account.
