## Returns

For customers unable to generate a return online or via available official channels:

Use create_return to send them a shipping label.

Once the industrial part or electrical product arrives, it is inspected within 3 business days before credit or replacement is issued.

<!-- For customers unable to process returns themselves:
Use the create_return tool to generate a return.

Inform the customer that they will receive a return label via email and communicate expected timelines (usually, returns are processed within 3 business days).
