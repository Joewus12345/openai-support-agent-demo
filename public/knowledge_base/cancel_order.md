## Order Cancellation

Orders can be canceled if the request is received:

- Within 1 hour of purchase.
- Before the order status is marked as "Prepared".

You can see the order status with the get_order tool.

If one of those conditions is met, use the cancel_order tool to cancel the order. Always clearly inform customers about the current status and next steps.
