# PPA Future Leaders Educational Fund (PPAFLEF), 2024/2025 Academic Year Scholarships
  * [ October 8, 2024 ](https://automationghana.com/2024/10/08/)


The Automation Ghana Group (TAGG), through its Process & Plant Automation Limited (PPA) Future Leaders’ Fund Scholarship Programme, continues to support the education of pupils at Baatsona Primary and Junior High Schools (JHS). The scholarship, launched in 2016, is dedicated to ensuring that children facing financial difficulties have access to quality education.
On the occasion of the 9th scholarship award presentation, TAGG reaffirmed its commitment to empowering pupils from Baatsona Primary and JHS as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts. The 2024 scholarship program provides full support for students, including school levies, uniforms, shoes, textbooks, and stationery, ensuring they can focus on their studies without financial concerns.

This year’s scholarship has enrolled pupils from kindergarten through JHS, with an additional focus on STEM education through the **Infinity Club** , an initiative designed to ignite interest in science and technology. The club, originally catering to 24 students, has expanded to 74 participants due to its popularity, encouraging students to explore innovative ideas and consider careers in STEM fields.
Ms. Winnie Wekete Sinabisi, Human Resource and Administration Manager of TAGG, praised the progress of scholarship recipients, stating that all students from last year’s cohort were retained, except for those who had graduated from JHS. “ _We are pleased with their academic progress and remain dedicated to supporting their educational journey_ ,” she noted.

Ms. Sinabisi emphasized TAGG’s long-term commitment to equipping future leaders with the education and skills needed to positively impact society. She also expressed gratitude to the teachers and parents for their role in making the program a success.
In support of the initiative, Mr. Isaac MacCarthy-Mensah, Tema West Municipal Director of Education, applauded TAGG’s efforts, while calling on other private organizations to assist in addressing the challenges facing public schools, including overcrowding and infrastructure limitations.
