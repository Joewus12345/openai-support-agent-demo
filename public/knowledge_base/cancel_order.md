## Order Cancellation

Automation equipment orders can be cancelled if the request arrives:

- Within 1 hour of placing the order.
- Before the order status shows "Prepared for shipment."

Check the status with the get_order tool. If eligible, use cancel_order to stop the shipment and confirm with the customer.
