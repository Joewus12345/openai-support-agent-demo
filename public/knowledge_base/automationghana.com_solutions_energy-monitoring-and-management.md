## Benefits
## Transparent and Accurate Billing of all users 
Our EMMX eliminates the need for manual meter reading and associated human errors. Energy usage is recorded in real-time and stored on the emmX platform. All stakeholders can check meter readings remotely from a designated workstation, tablet or smartphone.
Track energy consumption on multiple energy sources per user (or tenant). Generate energy bills that clearly state how much energy was used on utility supply and on shared back up energy sources (Generators and Renewable energy sources)
## Data Driven Forecasts and budgeting
  * Access historical energy consumption reports and bills
  * Generate trends and analyse consumption data for any period ( month on month, year on year, 5 year, 10 year, etc)
  * This allows you to determine 
    * baseline consumption patterns,
    * forecast future utilization,
    * determine impact of increase or decrease in energy demand on your overall budget, operational efficiency and business profitability.


## Monitor and Limit Energy Consumption
Gain the ability to not just monitor, but actively limit your energy use, leading to significant cost savings and a more sustainable operational model.
This strategic approach to energy management empowers you to identify inefficiencies and optimize your consumption patterns, ensuring your resources are used judiciously.
## Scalable custom design unique to your specific needs
  * Measure energy usage in common areas (such as the lobby, outdoor lighting, pool area, car parks etc) and share equally among users.
  * Introduce service charges (generator maintenance, facility fees), tariffs, etc.
  * Introduce additional meters at anytime.
  * Monitor several facilities or locations across the world with our emmX Cloud solution.


## Enhanced Safety
Real-time diagnostics and power quality measurement feature simplifies fault finding and reduces down time. emmX is an invaluable tool for facility managers and maintenance technicians.**Measure**
  * Power factor
  * Harmonics
  * Overvoltage,
  * Undervoltage
  * Earth leakage or Ground fault current.


Implement multiple security access levels and ensure that your data remains protected and accessible only to authorized personnel. Safeguard sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access.
## System Updates 
Free updates for bug fixes, operational efficiency etc. 
## System Integration
  * Reduce overall cost of your metering and power distribution assets with our integrated Smart Power Distribution solution.
  * This is a custom solution designed based on your physical requirements and budget.
  * The Smart Distribution solution reduces cabling and physical space requirements thus reducing capital expenditure.
  * Ideal for new and expansion projects.
