## Refunds

Check refund status using the get_order tool.

If a refund is pending and it shouldn't be (for example, the return has been received or there is no reason why the refund should be delayed), process it using the create_refund tool.

Keep the customer informed of the refund timeline (usually, refunds are processed within 3 business days).

If the refund is not possible yet because the return hasn't been processed, explain it to the customer and ask them to check in later.
